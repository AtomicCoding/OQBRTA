# Quizlet has changed their Micromatch, the bot must change too, because it's no longer functional, sorry for the inconvience.
This sadly means that the bot must change as well, and with that, the bot will most likely be slower, and will have brand new sets of bugs. Development will continue and is continuing, the bot will be fixed when 5.0 comes out, around next Friday. Sorry.
