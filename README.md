# Quizlet has changed Micromatch
This means that the bot must change as well, and with that, the bot will most likely be slower, and will have brand new sets of bugs. Development will continue and is continuing, the bot will be fixed when 5.0 comes out, soon. Sorry.
# 5.0 was supposed to come out today
OQBRTA is functional in 5.0, but is still filled with bugs. I am still working on it. Thanks for supporting this project.
